					for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
					The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
					the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

					‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
					professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
					student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
					staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
					agile team
					project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
					tutorial
					could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
					experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
					offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
